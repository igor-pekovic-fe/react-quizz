## QuizWizz

This React application was built as the final solo challenge in Scrimba's free React course taught by Bob Ziroll - https://twitter.com/bobziroll

## Features

The application performs an API call to https://opentdb.com/ and renders 5 questions of varying difficulty to the player.
Once all answers have been chosen, the player can check the answers and receive a score based on how many were correct.

On top of the base features the challenge asked for, I've added some additional ones:

- ability to pick quiz difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, All)
- button to go back to start screen

Some features which will be added in the future:

- ability to pick how many questions should be in the quiz
- ability to store the score in localStorage
- display high scores on the start screen
- darkmode
